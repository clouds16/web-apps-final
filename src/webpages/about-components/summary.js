				Travelo started with a passion for traveling. In my early 20's, the
				founder would work multiple jobs and save up every penny until he had
				enough money to take a trip to another country. Throughout his travels,
				he experienced new cultures, learned new languages , and made long time
				friends. Through this passion, he decided to start a company that would
				help the customer travel as it was intended. Travelo is the best way to
				travel, as we provide the housing, and transportation. Additionally we
				host a variety of servicesand connections that the customer has
				available to them. Come and find out why Travelo has been the best way
				for anyone, of any age and background , to experience!
